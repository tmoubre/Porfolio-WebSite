I want to say that i was not able to use the link provided to do the browser compatability testing. I did use one that was free for 3 tests but there were not any report about the outcome. I will be happy to try this step again if there is another site.

Vendor property not set in StyleLint for the  -ms-grid-row: and -ms-grid-column:, I am not familiar enough whith setting the property to know how to fix this. 


.grid {
  display: -ms-grid;
  display: grid;
  -ms-grid-columns: 1fr 20px 1fr 20px 1fr;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  -ms-grid-rows: 1fr 20px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
  margin-left: 50px;
  margin-right: 50px;
  grid-gap: 20px;
  text-align: center;


}

.grid > *:nth-child(1) {
  -ms-grid-row: 1;
  -ms-grid-column: 1;
}

.grid > *:nth-child(2) {
  -ms-grid-row: 1;
  -ms-grid-column: 3;
}

.grid > *:nth-child(3) {
  -ms-grid-row: 1;
  -ms-grid-column: 5;
}

.grid > *:nth-child(4) {
  -ms-grid-row: 3;
  -ms-grid-column: 1;
}

.grid > *:nth-child(5) {
  -ms-grid-row: 3;
  -ms-grid-column: 3;
}

.grid > *:nth-child(6) {
  -ms-grid-row: 3;
  -ms-grid-column: 5;
}

the button class and psuedo class do not like that the property is all on one line. STYLINT is set to force a new line. 

button {
  &:hover, &:focus {
    /* lets move the mouse apper as hand when hovering */
    cursor: pointer;

    /* reduces the opacity of the button */
    opacity: 0.8;
  }
}

.button__primary {
  &:hover, &:focus {
    /* lets move the mouse apper as hand when hovering */
    cursor: pointer;

    /* reduces the opacity of the button */
    opacity: 0.8;
  }
}
